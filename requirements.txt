# This file collects all required third-party packages that are needed
# to run this project. Later you can install all these apps in a row
# using pip. Example::
#
#     venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt

# But first you must set up the virtual environment. Use at least python3.7
# and do this in the Zeugs base folder:
#     python3 -m venv venv
#     venv/bin/pip install --upgrade pip
