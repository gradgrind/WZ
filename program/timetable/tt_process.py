"""
To allow parallel "runs" it would be necessary to duplicate the data
structures which can be modified. That is, things like allocation arrays
and constraint "penalties". Basic, fixed, data structures (e.g. Teachers,
Activities?) could be shared between "runs".

Demands:
 - Check if activity can be placed in a particular period (-> delta penalty?).
 - Place activity (changes penalty).

A check will consider teachers and pupil groups and various constraints,
which could concern subjects, etc.
Is it possible to avoid getting multiple penalties when multiple atomic
groups are concerned? If the constraints are activity-based and not
group-based this should be automatic.

Performing a check, various constraint penalties can be changed. These
need to be collected separately or managed in such a way that they can
be reverted easily. This could be a list of (constraint, new value) pairs.
The new value could also be a delta. It would also be possible to build
a complete new constraint-penalty array. Depending on the memory management,
that could even be more efficient. That would be a sort of snapshot
arrangenment, and conceptually nice and simple!

Then there is the question of whether I want to move to integer-indexed
arrays for the items that are currently string-indexed. Would there be
a significant efficiency improvement (in Python!)? It might be sensible
to start without the transformation, as this would be "simpler". It
could be modified if improvements are needed.

It would probably be good to have just one master placement map, which
could be an array of placements (day + period), one for each activity â€“
a single value, week-period, would be more compact ...

How would a check go?
 - Groups busy/blocked?
 - Teachers busy/blocked?
 - class/group lunch breaks
 - (*) class/group gaps
 - (*) class/group min. lessons
 - ...
 - (*) teacher gaps
 - (*) teacher min. lessons
 - teacher max. block length
 - teacher lunch breaks
 - ...

 - activities: subjects on same day
 - activities: subject ordering

 - Rooms busy/blocked? This is tricky because there might be a list of
 alternatives for some or all of the rooms. If there is a free room in
 the list, that can be taken. If not, the activities using the rooms in
 the list need to be checked to find out if they can use an alternative ...

 - ...

Some of the constraints (*) are not so suited for insertion testing, they
are rather orientated towards final evaluation of the completed timetable.
Perhaps these should be kept separate. In an allocation algorithm there
might need to be special handlers.
