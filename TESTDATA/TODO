## Configuration files which belong to the new structure:

 - Fachliste. Subjects, (key: full name). Currently NOT MINION, some names
   have space characters in them.

 - CONFIG. Basic configuration stuff, especially for localization (including
   the names/paths of other files here!). MINION.

 - Schuldaten. Configuration items specifically for the school. MINION.

 - Kalender. Information about the current school year (primarily dates).
   MINION.

Of these only Kalender will change from one year to the next.

The other files have not been updated or deleted for the new structure.

## Folders:

 - Klassen. Contains pupil and class-subject data for the current year.

 - RESOURCES. Templates and such-like. Not specific to the current year,
   but, at least in part, to the school.

 - testing. Only in the test-data. It contains files related to the test
   code integrated in the source files.

 - logs. This is currently in the base folder of the project, but it
   might be sensible to move it to the data folder.

 - CURRENT(?). Doesn't exist yet. For the data that arises during the
   year. NOT stuff that should be archived.

 - SCHOOLYEAR. This is for the results, including grade tables, report
   texts, etc. This will form the basis of the data that is archived.
